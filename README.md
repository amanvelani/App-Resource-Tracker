## Roadmap

- Linking of processes with their corresponding applications
- Utilizing the Mac platform for Android operations while acknowledging the OS-dependency in data collection.
- Automated process termination based on a comprehensive allowlist
- Integration of a JSON/CSV file from a trusted source to build and update an allowlist. Additionally, the application can identify and terminate processes that are not part of the allowlist while logging this information for future improvements.
- Implementation of a static whitelist that doesn't require user input.
